# data-structure-exercises

Welcome to data-structure-and-algorithms repository!

This repository is here just helping  me saving my solutions while I am studying Data Structures and Algorithms.

I am using some books by reference like Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms by Loiane Groner.
She is a brazilian writer and has a great didactic, I started doing her online course
then I wanted to go deeper. Guided by the book, I am puting into practice the exercises using Java.

I also  include here some Hacker Rank challanges resolution.

The most code are about:
- Queue
- Linked List
- Dictionary or hashmap
- Tree
- Graph
- ...

As the learning never ends this it can be incremented over time.
