# data-structure-exercises

Welcome to data-structure-and-algorithms repo!

I started this repository to training while I am studyng Data Structures and Algorithms.

Due to pression of time I noticed that rarely we, developers, take a break to improve our algorithms to be more
performatic and efficient. Sometimes we just want to solve fast and do not have a break to thinking
in the best solution. So now as I am somewhat experience, I have been learned that If I wanted to be a better problem solver I should training day-to-day
while I am out of the situation , so that I will be more prepared when the situation ask more
agility. Thus, I just have to pick the knowledge on my repertoire.

I am using some books by reference like

Learning JavaScript Data Structures and Algorithms by Loiane Groner.
She is a brazilian writer and has a great didactic, I started doing her online course
then I wanted to go deeper. Guided by the book, I am puting into practice the exercises using Java.

I also  include here some Hacker Rank challanges resolution.

The most code are about:
- Queue
- Linked List
- Dictionary or hashmap
- Tree
- Graph
- ...

As the learning never ends this repository can be incremented over time.
